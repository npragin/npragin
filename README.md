# üëã Noah Pragin ‚Äì CS @ Oregon State

Hi there! I'm an undergrad passionate about autonomous systems. I'm currently TAing machine learning while studying robotic software.

### üî≠ Current Focus
- Autonomous systems
- Machine / Deep / Reinforcement learning
- 3D Computer Vision
- Motion planning for robotics

### üß† Recent Projects

- [**Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Docking RL**](https://github.com/npragin/learning-based-docking): Developed policies for AUVs that generalize to out-of-distribution dynamics in NVIDIA Isaac.
  
- [**Human Pose Estimation Comparison**](https://github.com/npragin/hpe-mpii-comparative): Built and compared three primary paradigms for human pose estimation using PyTorch.
  
- [**Informative Path Planning w/ CNNs**](https://github.com/npragin/mnist-exploration-robot): Created an agent that explores maps to classify handwritten digits and navigate to dynamic goals.
  
- [**ROS Exploration & Mapping**](https://github.com/npragin/ros-backup): Implemented path planning and obstacle avoidance for a robot to map a 6-room environment.

### üå± Research Interests
Exploring motion planning in instance-segmented point clouds and how to incorporate natural language into optimization problems.

### üîç Previous Experience
- Contributed to a research lab developing four-wheeled apple-picking robots
- Interned at [a startup](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sifly/) working on UAVs for agriculture
- Worked with [FSAE team](https://www.global-formula-racing.com/en/) on fully autonomous racecar software
- Former full-stack web developer (2-year industry experience)
